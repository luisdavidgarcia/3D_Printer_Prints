# 3D_Printer_Prints üñ®Ô∏è
Three print tests for my Ender 3. 

After nearly half of year of doubt I got into 3D printer and successfully ran three decent prints. 

The 3D dog does contain quite the smile üòÄ due to running out of filament midway. I panicked, but I unconciously paused the print job to think of a solution. 

I opted to use black filament instead, which gave me a cow patterned dog.

### X Test ‚ùå

The X test is critical to seeing if your extruder has enough squish with the Ender's bed. I made sure to look out for any ridges and gaps since the ridges indicate there is too much squish, while gaps indicate too little.

### 2mm Cube Test ‚¨ú

The cube was a failed first attempt, until I discovered that I need to level the Ender's bed for each print to ensure I prevent the likelyhood of a wasted print.

### Dog Test üê∂

Cal the dog is the print that I learnt most from not from it taking 2.5 hours, but I learned what to do in a time of panic. I used instinct to refill the printer with new filament, despite the white filament not completing finishing.

Fortuantely my printer was smart enough to pull the black filament forward as it did with the old one.

### Cup Print

On Fusion 360, I designed my own cup for learning the fundamentals of how to 
user that CAD software. I now use it a little garbage bin for electronic
components or scraps when working on electronics projects and ones like these.

### Xbox 360 Controller Stand Print

I printed an Xbox 360 Controller stand I found on <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1012779">thingiverse</a>.
However a fatal flaw of mine was not orienting the stand correctly for the print, 
so I had a botched job. However, from such mistakes comes confidence as know I
now what to do next time, particularly that I have control over the orientation 
of my prints. Also my Xbox 360 controllers stood well in the stand. Although,
I am not much of a gamer anymore I do enjoy them as a DVD player and general
media device.
