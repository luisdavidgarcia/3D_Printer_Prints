# 3D_Printer_Testing
Three print tests for my Ender 3. 

After nearly half of year of doubt I got into 3D printer and successfully ran three decent prints. 

The 3D dog does contain quite the smile ðŸ˜€ due to running out of filament midway. I panicked, but I unconciously paused the print job to think of a solution. 

I opted to use black filament instead, which gave me a cow patterned dog.

### X Test

The X test is critical to seeing if your extruder has enough squish with the Ender's bed. I made sure to look out for any ridges and gaps since the ridges indicate there is too much squish, while gaps indicate too little.




### 2mm Cube Test

The cube was a failed first attempt, until I discovered that I need to level the Ender's bed for each print to ensure I prevent the likelyhood of a wasted print.



### Dog Test

Cal the dog is the print that I learnt most from not from it taking 2.5 hours, but I learned what to do in a time of panic. I used instinct to refill the printer with new filament, despite the white filament not completing finishing.

Fortuantely my printer was smart enough to pull the black filament forward as it did with the old one.
